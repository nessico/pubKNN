Download the repository then either run ```python3 classif.py``` or ```python3 MVE.py``` on the command line or the terminal after changing the input and output files. Remember to change the directory to where you downloaded the file to as well.
For MVE.py, move MVE.py, MissingData1.txt, MissingData2.txt, MissingData3.txt into the same folder, then execute MVE.py
